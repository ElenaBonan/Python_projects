# Python_projects

In this repository you can find the projects I have done in Python. More precisely:
- <b> Hotel Booking demand </b> This notebook is about a classification problem. Indeed, I want to predict if a customer is going to cancel or not his/her hotel reservation.
-  <b> Food recognition </b> In this notebook I train some models for image recognition and implement some visualization techniques for understanding what happen to the images when they go through the convolutional layers.
