# Hotel Booking Demand
In this project we are using data coming from two hotels, more precisely every row corrispond to a reservation. Using the available information at the moment of the booking (expected arrival date, deposit type, type of room etc.),
we want to predict if a customer is going to cancel or not the reservation. 

<b>Problem:</b> binary classification <br>
<b>Target variable:</b> is_canceled <br>
<b>Independent variables:<b> 31 (numerical and categorical) <br>
<b>Data source</b>: https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand <br>
